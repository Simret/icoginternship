        <section class="intro">
            <h2>Interview Process</h2>
            <p>My journey at iCog Labs began in May when I saw the call for interns and eagerly submitted my application along with my CV. After a few months of anticipation, I was thrilled to receive an invitation for an interview at the end of September. The interview went well, and I was officially offered the internship opportunity. My internship at iCog Labs officially started shortly thereafter, marking the beginning of an exciting and enriching chapter in my career.</p>
